# Honey-Pot-Creation-for-Home-Lab
Designed, built, and automated a production-grade honeypot environment using OpenCanary on MX Linux as part of a home SOC lab. The system was engineered for stealth, persistence, and seamless integration with eventual Elastic Stack (via Kali Purple) for centralized monitoring and analysis.
